        <h1>Welcome to the world of coffee</h1>
        <p>Coffee is a beverage brewed from roasted, ground coffee beans.</p>
        

        <h2>Coffea arabica is a species of “coffee plant” that’s used in around 60% of the world’s coffee production — it’s the most widely grown and consumed species of coffee in the world. 

        </h2>
        <p>Arabica's popularity stems from its unique flavor profile, which can be described as smooth, mild, and fruity but can vary widely depending on both the cultivar and the climate in which it was grown.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Arabica's flavor profile is much more complex and less bitter than other species of coffee — such as Coffea canephora (also known as Coffea robusta) or Coffea liberica. The tradeoff is that arabica coffee only contains about half as much caffeine as these other varieties.</li>
